# Skip List
### Description

This package implements a skip list, a probabilistic data structure 
often used as an alternative to balanced trees, like AVL or red-black. Skip lists have an average-case time 
complexity of O(log N) and worst-case of O(N) for searching for, inserting, and 
deleting elements, where N is the number of elements in the list.
